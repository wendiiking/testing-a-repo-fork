### <span style="color:grey">Blanks And #REF

After going through the dataset, I noticed that there were some blank columns at the end and some of the columns had the #REF error in them and some of the had free written under the size column.

### <span style="color:grey"> Cleaned dataset
So I cleaned up the dataset by converting the portion of the file holding the data to a table with headers. I changed the font style and size them made the header to be bold so it would be easier to understand. I used the drop down arrowon the table header to fiilter out the blanks and errors.
