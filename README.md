### <span style="color:grey"> __Steps for the days task based on the data files :__ 
 

#### Basics Steps (Individual)

* Download the dataset from Kaggle and save locally to your FSDB project management folder.

* Pick one out of the 7 datasets provided by kaggle (csv).

* Write the csv file you have chosen to work on today in the comment here (to avoid double work from another)

* Create child-issues in this user story detailing out the insights or questions you got based on the dataset.

* Create also locally a documentation in markdown format (.md) that explains the details of the dataset, key insights based on the business understanding(requirements) user story we did yesterday.
  - try to connect and group possible fitting business requirements to chosen dataset file based on your data understanding.

 

#### More steps (Team-work)

* Git/Github Steps:

  - Clone the  project repository GitHub - FSDB-Full-Stack-Data-Brains/e-commerce-data-driven-solutions to your local project portfolio folder. e.g on terminal: git clone <ssh_code_link> 

  - Check the current state of your local repo or branch e.g on terminal: git status

  - Create new branch with a branch name containing your name e.g on terminal : git switch -c  grace_ecommerce_branch

  - Switch to new branch you created with a branch name containing your name e.g on terminal : git switch -c  grace_ecommerce_branch

  - Add files you want to your own branch you created e.g on terminal : git add <file name>

  - Commit the tracked files e.g on terminal : git commit -m  <custom_message>

  - Push changes to the remote branch you created connecting to Github e.g  on terminal :  git push --set-upstream <branch_name> (this command is for first time push to new branch) or git push (for regular push to your branch)

  - etc (for next activity like creating pull requests on github)


* Extra Steps:

  - Data Curation

  - Perform data cleaning

  - Carry out Exploratory Data Analysis 

  - Key questions and business solutions

  - Data modelling and Visualization

  - Can use tools like Python, Excel, SQL, Powerbi or Tableau etc
