---

### Steps (Team Collaboration)
  
* Access the Kaggle Dataset: [E-commerce Sales Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data.)

* Understand and discuss the stakeholders business requirements based on the brief provided (i.e details published in the about section on kaggle).
  
  - The Stakeholders in this scenario are both the kaggle dataset publishers and also us as team since its a kaggle challenge.

* Sprint Planning using Jira Software:
  
  - Agile project planning using scrum methodology

  -  On Jira reate child-issues in the user story, (DSPM - 29)[business_understanding] detailing out the possible business requirements gotten from the brief and discuss.
  
  - Create sprint, set sprint details add issues from backlog to sprint and start sprint. (2 weeks sprint, 16.04.2023 - 23.04.2023)

### Basics Steps (Individual)

* Download the dataset from Kaggle and save locally to your FSDB project management folder.

* Pick one out of the 7 datasets provided by kaggle (csv).

* Write the csv file you have chosen to work on today in the comment here (to avoid double work from another)

* Create child-issues in this user story, (DPSM-30)[data_investigation_stage] detailing out the insights or questions you got based on the dataset.

* About the data file chosen: Create also locally a documentation in markdown format (.md) that explains the details of the dataset, key insights based on the business understanding(requirements) user story we did yesterday.
  
  - try to connect and group possible fitting business requirements to chosen dataset file based on your data understanding.

 

### More steps (Team-work)

* Git/Github Steps:

  - Clone the  project repository GitHub - FSDB-Full-Stack-Data-Brains/e-commerce-data-driven-solutions to your local project portfolio folder. e.g on terminal: git clone <ssh_code_link> 

  - Check the current state of your local repo or branch e.g on terminal: git status

  - Create new branch with a branch name containing your name e.g on terminal : git switch -c  grace_ecommerce_branch

  - Switch to new branch you created with a branch name containing your name e.g on terminal : git switch -c  grace_ecommerce_branch

  - Add files you want to your own branch you created e.g on terminal : git add <file name>

  - Commit the tracked files e.g on terminal : git commit -m  <custom_message>

  - Push changes to the remote branch you created connecting to Github e.g  on terminal :  git push --set-upstream <branch_name> (this command is for first time push to new branch) or git push (for regular push to your branch)

  - etc (for next activity like creating pull requests on github)


* Extra Steps:

  - Data Curation
  
  - Key questions and business solutions

  - Perform data cleaning
  
  - Data modelling 

  - Carry out Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (This is for next stage though)

  - Can use tools like Python, Excel, SQL, Powerbi or Tableau etc

* Key Questions to Help Guide your Data Investigation Documentation Process

  - What details did you find out about the dataset?
  - What are the important dataset properties you think is in the data file?
  - Based on your data investigation, could you find any correlation between your data file and the business requirements listed in the (DSPM-21)[business_understanding] user story? 
  - Are there any other possible business problems you think could be tackled by us?
  - Based on both the business and data understanding process we have tackled, could you think of any business solution(s) we could implement?
